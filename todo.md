  - [x] acceptance tests with realistic app setup
  - [x] todo service with sequelize store
- [x] tiny react app for demo purposes (hello user)
- [x] demo todos in react app
  - [x] ts-rest setup
  - [x] migrate other routes to ts-rest
  - [x] dev data management (add test users via API)
  - [x] login (see user info)
  - [x] dev data management (add todos via API)
  - [x] view all todos for user
- [x] organize schemas and domain code
- [x] extract all domain packages to lib directory
- [ ] demo 'modular monolith' restrictions on cross-domain imports
- [ ] demo logging implementation
- [ ] remove sqlite (use mysql for unit testing mysql-specific adapter code)
- [ ] remove testing-library? I think vitest already provides all these tools?
- [ ] general code duplication and cruft cleanup
- [ ] add demo logging infrastructure (otel?)
- [ ] add unit tests for infrastructure utility library
- [ ] add enough react code to make the demo look pretty
- [ ] update readme with more documentation
  - [ ] how to run
    - [ ] (devbox and docker prereqs)
    - [ ] npm workspaces setup
    - [ ] npm workspace npm install (what happens when you run install)
    - [ ] what does npm run dev do
  - [ ] what the quality script does
  - [ ] unit testing vs acceptance testing
  - [ ] ts-rest and end to end type safety
  - [ ] error handling with neverthrow
  - [ ] hexagonal architecture:
    - [ ] using zod to define domain model schemas
    - [ ] using services to define domain model operations
    - [ ] multiple drivers (http api vs dev seeders)
    - [ ] multiple implementations of external systems
- [ ] basic authorization demo

## polish and next steps

- [ ] remove unnecessary dependencies (vitest now does most of what testing-library does, I think)
- [ ] existing JWT polish (e.g., invalidate all users on logout) or just integrate something like OpenAuth to show full OAuth implementation
