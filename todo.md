## milestone 2: cleanup and authorization

- [x] manual review of readme
- [ ] openapi generation from ts-rest schema
- [ ] review error response schemas and unions (see docs/CODE_CLEANUP_RECOMMENDATIONS.md)
- [ ] add demo logging infrastructure (otel?)
- [ ] show how to run one set of test against different implementations of an adapter
- [ ] basic authorization demo
- [ ] add enough react code to make the demo look pretty
- [ ] existing JWT polish (e.g., invalidate all users on logout) or just integrate something like OpenAuth to show full OAuth implementation
